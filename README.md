# TMDBClient_Class
Toy app for practicing Android development. TMDBClient_Class is an example app that uses the TMDB API to display popular movies, artists, and TV shows.

## Motivation
Practice the use of the following design patterns / technologies

- MVVM Architecture
- Clean Architecture
  - Uncoupled DATA, DOMAIN, and PRESENTATION layers 
- Dependency Injection w/ Dagger
- Retrofit
- Room
- Coroutines
- Data Binding

## Screenshots
Presentation design was not the focus of the app therefore the interface is fleshed out just enough to test the main functionality.
